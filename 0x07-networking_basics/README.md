## OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers.

## Types of Networks

### LAN Network

A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or building.

### WAN Network

A WAN (Wide Area Network) is a network that spans a large geographical area, connecting LANs and other networks over long distances.

### Internet

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that communicate using standardized protocols.

## MAC Address

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication on a network segment.

## IP Address

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the IP for communication.

### Private and Public Addresses

Private IP addresses are reserved for use within private networks, while public IP addresses are globally unique addresses used for communication over the Internet.

### IPv4 and IPv6

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) are the two main versions of the IP protocol used for addressing and routing packets on the Internet.

### Localhost

Localhost refers to the loopback network interface of a device, allowing communication with itself.

## TCP and UDP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are transport layer protocols used for transmitting data over networks.

## TCP/UDP Ports List

TCP and UDP use port numbers to identify specific applications or services on a network.

## Ping / ICMP

Ping is a network utility used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is the protocol used by ping for this purpose.

## Positional Parameters

Positional parameters refer to the command-line arguments passed to a script or program in a specific order.
